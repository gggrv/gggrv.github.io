Human and machine-readable harmonica tabs + tools.

<!--more-->

### About

"Harmonica" is a small and very loud musical instrument.

"Harmonica tab" is a very simplified type of sheet music.

There is no strict standard for harmonica tabs.

Using `.yaml` to write harmonica tabs allows to avoid quite a lot of headaches.

### Benefits

- It is easy to convert `.yaml` harmonica tab into beautiful pdf/image/any other document with any desired note labels, typesetting.
- It is easy to distinguish between playable notes, lyrics, metadata.
- It is possible to programmatically shift all notes several keys up/down.
- It is possible to programmatically transpose the melody to fit any other harmonica.
- It is possible to programmatically estimate song difficulty and any other custom parameters.
- It is still human readable and portable enough.

Judging tab difficulty is problematic.  
Detecting, which harmonica is used, is problematic.  
Learning, who wrote the song, is problematic.
