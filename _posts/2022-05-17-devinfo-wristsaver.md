Generate handwritten text.

<!--more-->

### About

`UTAU`, but for handwriting.

### Benefits

Create custom handwritten type and print simple `html`-formatted documents with it.

Apply custom hand wavering, misalign straight lines of text for more natural feel.

Define derivative types for **bold**, *italic* and other styles.

Define entire typesets for easy switching and document formatting.

Easily label handwriting data, train machine learning algorithms on this labeled data.

This is a logical clone of the `UTAU` program â€” any labeling techniques (for example `CV`, `VCV`, `CVC`, `bre`) are possible to implement (translated to handwriting, that could be `single letter`, `some syllable`, `whole word`, `whole phrase`, `ligature`).

### Rationale

`wristsaver` is an update of my old code with high sentimental value. After implementing core mechanics in the traditional way, I will switch to the machine learning part.
