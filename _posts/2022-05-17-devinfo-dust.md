All we are is dust in the wind.

### About

`foobar2000`'s `ID3 tag` editor, but not for music.

### Benefits

Create custom metadata for *anything*.

Rename/sort any files using that custom metadata.

Write custom plugins and parsers to automatically get some of the metadata.

Do anything else with mouse gestures.

### Rationale

There are way too many pointless files one needs to manage. Where were they saved? How were they named? What were they for? Write that down into custom metadata, automatically dump associated files to some folder and search for them via private self-hosted logical database rather then physical file system.
